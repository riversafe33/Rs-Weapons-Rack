Weapon Rack Script

This script allows you to place a weapon rack using an item and store your weapons in it. 

The rack is synchronized for all players, so when you store a weapon, it is also visibly placed on the rack.

Only the player who placed the rack has access to the stored weapons and can pick the rack back up.
